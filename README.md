# Click-A-Sketch

This was a class project I completed during my Spring 2016 semester at the University of St. Thomas.

A simple game inspired by the Etch A Sketch. The left palette controls the writing color and the right
palette controls the background color.

Technologies Used: HTML, JavaScript, and TextPad 8
